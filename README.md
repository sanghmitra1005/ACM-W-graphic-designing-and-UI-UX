# ACM-W-graphic-designing-and-UI-UX
I completed the graphic designing task on canva and tried keeping it very basic by adding a few pictures, a techy background and minimal text. Figma was fun to learn. For the icons, i google free figma icons and also copy pasted some pics from google. Tried cloning the app as closely as i could have!
